    <string name="rocketDescription">When Rocket Raccoon deals damage to an enemy, he plants a hidden explosive on them. At the start of each round, the explosive has a 50% chance to detonate, dealing extra damage. If the enemy takes damage before their turn, the explosive triggers immediately, causing an additional chain reaction that damages nearby targets.</string>
